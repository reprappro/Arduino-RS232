Details about the RS232 driver circuit
--Written 20-07-2015 by Oliver Kesterton


The circuit was designed to allow an Arduino to control a Roland MDX-20 Modela CNC mill.

The circuit contains a MAX233 driver IC, and breaks out the TX, RX, RTS and CTS lines, enabling hardware flow control.

The system has been tested with an Arduino Mega with SD shield. It may work with other Arduino boards, but they will require at least
two serial ports. The MAX233 with 3.3V logic is untested.   

The Arduino program will make RTS (ready to send) high constantly, and will only send serial data when CTS (clear to send) is high.
Data is read from the SD card. Currently it looks for a file named "file.txt", but it should be relatively simple to modify the program
to ask for a filename, enabling any file to be read and sent.
