Instructions for PCB milling on the Roland MDX-20 Modela mill, using the custom serial driver board.

-------To mill PCB once machine instruction file produced:------------

1-Copy the milling file to the micro SD card, and rename it to "file.txt"
2-Plug everthing in (Arduino Mega pin mapping):
	Black = GND
	Orange = +5V
	Blue = RX = 19
	Green = TX = 18
	Red = CTS = 2
	Brown = RTS = 3

	If connections have come out of PCB, order is:
		Blue
		Green
		Brown
		Red
		Orange
		Black

3-Open serial monitor via Arduino software
4-Switch the mill on at the wall, and press the standby button. The power LED should light up
5-Press the 'View' button. The mill should move to the bottom left position (0,0 xy position). The tool z position will not change.
6a-Press 'Down' for a short time, so that the tool moves down a bit, but is still well above the work surface
	RUN THE CODE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS STATE, IN ORDER TO CHECK IT IS DOING WHAT IT SHOULD. ONCE SATISFIED IT IS
	RETURN TO INSTRUCTION 6b.

6b-Press 'Down' until the tool is just above the PCB, then adjust the tool until it is just touching the work surface.
	(unscrew the grub screw and let it drop out)
	-For files produced using the eagle add on, with no changes made to the file, the z tool-height is set wrong.
	Instead, lower the tool into the PCB slightly, to the desired cutting depth (about 3 presses of 'Down' is usually plenty).
	Note that the tool will move up before its first cut.
7-The Arduino serial monitor should say "Type G to begin". If not, press the reset button.
	Type 'G' (note, it is case sensitive) in the serial monitor and click send. The machine should begin cutting.
	Watch the tool closely initially. If it is doing weird things, press 'View' to pause the cut.
	Pressing 'View' again will return the tool to where it was
8-Once complete, the tool will return to the 0,0 position. Press 'View' to return the tool to its resting position, and extract the board.


To cancel a print, press 'View'. Once the tool has moved to its idle position, press the reset button on the Arduino and press the 
	'Up' and 'Down' buttons together to delete remaining commands from the buffer. The view LED will flash whilst this happens
	and will stop flashing once the program has been deleted.

--To generate milling script (RML-1 files)--------------------------------------------

Option 1 (easiest): CopperCAM (http://www.galaad.net/coppercam-eng.html)
	The program will open Gerber files and output RML-1 script.
	The program is fairly intutitive with good documentation. The generated RML-1 files work straight from the program.
	However, the program requires an 80 Euro licence.

Option 2: Eagle and a script to output RML-1 file (Detailed instructions here: http://mlab.taik.fi/paja/?p=1874)
	-In your Eagle install, change replace the eagle.def file with the one included in the "Eagle scripts" folder
	-In Eagle, go File>Run ULP and naviagate to fablab-mill-n-drill.ulp. 
		This should make some milling paths on layers 45 and 46 in Eagle
	-In the Eagle CAM processor, load the job fablab-mill-n-drill.CAM
		In each tab, change the X offset to be the width of the board, or greater. A Y offset is optional.
	-Click Process Job, and the RML-1 files should appear in the project directory.
